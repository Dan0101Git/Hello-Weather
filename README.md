Hello-Weather 🌦️
Hello-Weather is a sleek, modern, and responsive weather application that provides real-time weather data for any location. Built with a focus on a clean user interface and dynamic data visualization, it goes beyond simple forecasts to include an interactive thermal map and a persistent list of your favorite locations.

✨ Features
Real-time Weather Data: Get the current temperature, conditions, humidity, wind speed, and visibility for any city.

Global Search: Find weather information for any location in the world.

❤️ Favorites List: Save your most-viewed locations for quick access. The list stays dynamically updated with the latest conditions as you interact with the app.

🗺️ Interactive Thermal Map: As a map and geography nerd, I had to include this! The app features an interactive thermal (temperature) map, powered by the Windy.com API, to visualize weather patterns.

📊 24-Hour Forecast Chart: A smooth, interactive line graph showing the hourly temperature forecast.

📅 7-Day Forecast: A clear view of the weather for the upcoming week.

📱 Fully Responsive Design: A beautiful and seamless experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
